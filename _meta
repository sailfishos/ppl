  <title>The Parma Polyhedra Library: a library of numerical abstractions</title>
  <description>The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a library for the manipulation of
(not necessarily closed) convex polyhedra and other numerical
abstractions.  The applications of convex polyhedra include program
analysis, optimized compilation, integer and combinatorial
optimization and statistical data-editing.  The Parma Polyhedra
Library comes with several user friendly interfaces, is fully dynamic
(available virtual memory is the only limitation to the dimension of
anything), written in accordance to all the applicable standards,
exception-safe, rather efficient, thoroughly documented, and free
software.  This package provides all what is necessary to run
applications using the PPL through its C and C++ interfaces.
